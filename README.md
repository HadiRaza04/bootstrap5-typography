<h3>Try some typography from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">w3schools</a>.Heading sizes and much more.

1) Bootstrap 5 styles HTML headings <b>(<h1 to <h6) class h1-h6</b>  with a bolder font-weight and a responsive font-size.

2) Display headings are used to stand out more than normal headings (larger font-size and lighter font-weight), and there are six classes to choose from: <b>.display-1 to .display-6</b>.

3) In Bootstrap 5 the HTML <b><small</b> element (and the <b>.small</b> class) is used to create a <b>smaller, secondary text</b> in any heading.

4) Bootstrap 5 will style <b><mark</b> and <b>.mark</b> with a <b>yellow background color</b> and some padding.

5) Bootstrap 5 will style the HTML <b><abbr</b> element with a <b>dotted border bottom</b> and a cursor with question mark on hover.

6) Add the <b>.blockquote</b> class to a <b>blockquote></b> when quoting blocks of content from another source. And when naming a source, like "from WWF's website", use the <b>.blockquote-footer</b> class.

7) Other tags: <b>dl, code, kbd, pre</b>
